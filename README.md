# AlgoExpert-Duplicate
1. It was the time when i was learning layouts and decided to copy a website for practise
2. Algoexert.io catched my eyes, it was really a super cool website
3. At that time i did'nt knew about git and used github just as a server to upload my files(through copy paste)
4. One day my latop fell from a my bed and its hardisk got damaged
5. And there were few updates and sections that i have'nt uploaded on github, so after this painfull experience, i decided to move on and learn something new (and i was too lazy to recode) 
6. So this is how this project ended up

# what i learned 
1. css and layouts
2. never use laptop on bed
